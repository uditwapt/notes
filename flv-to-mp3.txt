flv to mp3

sudo apt-get install ecasound mpg123 lame ffmpeg
Restart your computer for ecasound to work correctly.

Code:
ffmpeg -i *.flv -f mp3 -vn -acodec copy /tmp/temp.mp3
ecasound -i /tmp/temp.mp3 -etf:8 -o ~/mysong.mp3
rm -f /tmp/temp.mp3
ffmpeg -i /path/to/video.flv /path/to/song.mp3

yea, but that way you lose a lot of the quality (the sound is encoded then in 64kbits)

Code:
ffmpeg -i /path/to/video.flv -ac 2 -ar 44100 -ab 320 /path/to/audio.mp3
probably that is not the best way to do it (as im not using the '-acodec codec), but i managed to get quite good quality with this.
-ac is number of audio channels
-ar is samplerate
-ab is bitrate
