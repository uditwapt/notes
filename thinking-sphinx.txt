An Introduction to Sphinx
========================================================================

- http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/sphinx_basics.html

- What is sphinx?
  - search engine
    - input: document
  - document
    - unique identifier
    - text
  - daemon indexes data
    - talks to data source
      - mysql
      - postgresql
      - xml
  - client searches sphinx db

- sphinx structure
  - daemon talks to collection of indexes
  - index
    - tracks documents
  - document
    - fields
    - attributes

- fields
  - field
    - content of search query
    - words tied to specific document
    - numbers and dates are treated as strings

- attributes
  - used to sort, filter and group search results
  - values are ignored in searches
  - can be integer, float, datetime, booleans, strings
  - string attributes are coverted to ordinal integers

- multi-value attrbutes
  - array of attributes for a single document
  - only integers are supported

Indexing your models
========================================================================

- http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/indexing.html

- define_index method
  - must be below associations

- fields
  - indexes method
    - references model's column names
    - cannot reference model methods
    - sphinx talks directly to db
    - why not just specify everything using a symbol???
  - :as
    - alias, as it appears in the sphinx db, I think
  - :sortable
  - :facet
    - what's a facet???
  - associations
    - index author(:name), :as => :author
      - index the name of the author of this document
    - index author.location, :as => :author_location
      - index the location of the author of this document
    - explicit aliases are required
    - can index raw sql
      - index "LOWER(first_name)", :as => :first_name

- attributes
  - has author_id
  - attributes are automatically sortable

- conditions and groupings
  - where "status = 'active'"
  - group_by "user_id"

- processing your index
  - rake ts:in
  - "distributed index cannot be directly indexed" is only a warning
  - structural changes to your index requires: stop, re-index, and restart
    - rake ts:rebuild

Searching
========================================================================

Testing
========================================================================

- http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/testing.html

- unit tests and specs
  - stub search calls

- cucumber
  - helper for cucumber
    - Cucumber::ThinkingSphinx::ExternalWorld.new
      - what does that do???

  - you need to turn off transaction fixtures
      - indexing will not include your transaction's changes

  - need to clear all the data between scenarios
  - Before block
  - use database clearner
    - model.delete_all

  - sphinx will automatically index and start daemon when you run
    feature, but only once at the very beginning, not for every scenario

  - to reindex during specific scenarios
    - ThinkingSphinx::Test.index; sleep(0.25) so that sphinx can catch up

- rails functional and integration tests
  - require 'thinking_sphinx/test'
  - ThinkingSphinx::Test.init

  - to run for all tests
    - ThinkingSphinx::Test.start_with_autostop

  - start and stop as required
    - ThinkingSphinx::Test.start
    - ThinkingSphinx::Test.stop
    - ThinkingSphinx::Test.run do end
    - ThinkingSphinx::Test.index
