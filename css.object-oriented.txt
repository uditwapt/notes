object oriented css

- web dev philosophy
	- respect design
	- respect original vision

- problems with css	
	- require expert ability just to get started
	- css file size just keeps getting bigger
	- code re-use is almost non-existent
	- code is too fragile

- two main principles
	- separate structure and skin
	- separate container and content
	
- component library

- separate container and content
	- break dependency between container module
		and content objects it contains
		
- contour blocks
        x
	background blocks
	      x
	content objects
	
- build html from component library
- site wide legos
